## Credit scores

These factors determine the credit score of a user:

> What much percentage of the approved limit has the customer used to take their active loans? Since it is recommended that 30% is ideal ([source]( https://www.paisabazaar.com/credit-score/cibil-score-calculation/)), we give scores based on that. Weightage is 25%.

> Percentage of EMIs paid on time vs EMIs not paid on time, since customers can pay in advance, a higher score is given to customers who pay in advance. Weightage is 30%.

> Customers who take loans for higher periods on average are given a higher score. Weightage is 15%.

> Older customers are trusted and deserve a higher rating, so the older loan the customer has taken the better the score they get. Weightage is 10%.

> The more loans they take, the higher the rating the customer gets. Weightage is 20%.

## Loan Approval

Based on the credit score of the customer, loans are approved as follows:

`Credit rating > 50: approve loan`

`50 > credit rating > 30: approve loans with interest rate > 12%`

`30 > credit rating > 10: approve loans with interest rate > 16%`

`10 > credit rating: don’t approve any loans`

`If the sum of all current EMIs exceeds 50% of the monthly salary, don’t approve any loans`

`If the interest rate does not match as per the credit limit, correct the interest rate in the response`
