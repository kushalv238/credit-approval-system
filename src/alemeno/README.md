## Loan Approval

Based on the credit score of the customer, loans are approved as follows:

`Credit rating > 50: approve loan`

`50 > credit rating > 30: approve loans with interest rate > 12%`

`30 > credit rating > 10: approve loans with interest rate > 16%`

`10 > credit rating: don’t approve any loans`

`If the sum of all current EMIs exceeds 50% of the monthly salary, don’t approve any loans`

`If the interest rate does not match as per the credit limit, correct the interest rate in the response`
